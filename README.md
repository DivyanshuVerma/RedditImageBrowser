Reddit Image Browser
====================

A client application which lets you browse images posted on reddit without the need of a browser.
It will download the images, then display them on a GUI.
Will be developed first for
http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/
as this idea striked me while I was browsing pics there :)
Then, I will generalise it.

Updates
-------

* Developed the basic GUI, code parses the links, images are downloaded and viewed, Scrollbar added for larger images.
* Local storage of files that have been downloaded once is also added. So, once you view an image, whenever you view it later on, you can view it faster. It doesn't need to be downloaded. 
* Also, have to work with different pages with other search results of the same link.
* Plus, have to add the feature to do the downloading of images that you are yet to view in the background.

To Run
-------

Open terminal and go to the source directory. Compile and run using `java UI`

Runs on both windows and linux.
