==UNDER DEVELOPMENT==

A client application which lets you browse images posted on reddit without the need of a browser.
It will download the images, then display them on a GUI.
Will be developed first for
http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/
as this idea striked me while I was browsing pics there :)
Then, I will generalise it.
