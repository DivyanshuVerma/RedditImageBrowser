==UNDER DEVELOPMENT==

My first application, which is started after I made an account on github.
A client application which lets you browse images posted on reddit without the need of a browser.
It will download the images, then display them on a GUI.
Will be developed first for
http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/
as this idea striked me while I was browsing pics there :)
Then, I will generalise it.

Updates:
>>Developed the basic GUI, code parses the links, images are downloaded and viewed. Images are scaled to fit in the GUI area.
>>Scrollbar added.
>>Have to work with the previous button, plus local storage of the images that are downloaded.
>>Also, have to work with different pages with other search results of the same link.

Thanks to Jsoup [http://jsoup.org/] for the HTML parsing Library :)
