==UNDER DEVELOPMENT==

A client application which lets you browse images posted on reddit without the need of a browser.
It will download the images, then display them on a GUI.
Will be developed first for
http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/
as this idea striked me while I was browsing pics there :)
Then, I will generalise it.

>>Developed the basic UI, and displays the debian logo demo image.
>>Code for parsing of link, and downloading the image is ready
>>Just linking of the GUI with the parser and image downloader is left.
>>After that, focus will be on alignment and size resolution of image and development of GUI.
